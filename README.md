# Eta

> `Eta` stands for efficiency. As in my opinion every developer tool should strive for!

Eta is an in-development code editor built with Rust and leveraging the Egui framework. As a project currently in beta, Eta aims to provide a modern, efficient coding environment that is both lightweight and powerful. Focused on simplicity and performance, Eta offers an evolving set of features designed to support developers in their coding endeavors across various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Project Status: Beta

Please note that Eta is currently in its beta phase. This means the software is in active development, and while it is functional, it may contain bugs or lack certain features planned for the final release. I welcome feedback and contributions from the community to help me improve and refine Eta.
